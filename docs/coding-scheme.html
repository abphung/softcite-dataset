<br />
<br />    Use this code multiple times, once for each mention. Name the mention so that it is the article title, preceded by an a, and followed by an underscore, then your initials, then a number. Start that number at 01 and increment one each time you find a new mention. Doesn't have to match the order the mentions are in the PDF.
<br />
<br />    Do not use this code if there were no software mentions (use coded_no_in_text_mentions instead).

<br />    If you find a mention in a footnote, code the footnote as one mention and the sentence the footnote linked to as another.</td><td>- Your first mention, if your initials are AB and the article title is 2002-22-AM_J_BOT would read a2002-22-AM_J_BOT_AB01
