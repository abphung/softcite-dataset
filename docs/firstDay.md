#Before the First Meeting

Before you can get started working on the Softcite project, you'll need several things downloaded on your computer. These should have been attended to before your first lab meeting, but, to double check, please ensure that:

1. You have Chrome installed on your computer. You can download it here: https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html.

1. You have downloaded the Atom text editor. You can download it here: https://atom.io.

1. You have Python 3 installed on your computer. If you don't have it already, I recommend installing Anaconda as it will also include a whole bunch of other packages that might be useful to you in the future. You can install Anaconda here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

1. If you work on a PC, you will need to install PuTTY. If you don't have it already, you can download it here: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html.

1. You have signed up for and downloaded the Chrome extension called Hypothesis. You can sign up and download the extension here: https://web.hypothes.is. You might need to check your email at some point during the sign up process to confirm your account.

#During the First meeting

After you have those five items installed on your computer, you are ready to attend the first meeting. There is still more setup to do before you can start training or collecting data, however. Follow these instructions to finish your set up:

1. If you do not have an account already, sign up for Github. You can sign up here: https://github.com/. Github is an online platform that allows users to share and document their code. It is built on the version control system, git. Git and Github are not the same thing, but Github adds functionality and a social/communicative aspect to git. Git itself allows you to keep track of versions of a file. We will discuss this more as a group.

1. You will also need an account to access the iSchool (Information School) server. Dr. Howison will help you create one of these. It might be helpful if your iSchool username and your Github username are the same.

*Note:* Students will need to be added to the allowed-users file for them to be able to access the repo on the iSchool server.

1. You will need to set up Atom so that it has all of the add-on packages we will be using. We will install four packages. To install the packages, in Atom, click on **File** (for PC users) or Atom (for Mac users). Then click on **Preferences**. A new menu will appear:

1. Set up your .ftpconfig file

1. Open the coding scheme
